## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.2]: silverreyes.net design system for Nostradamus -- cohesive brand across subdomains
- [v1.2]: Over/under deferred to v1.3 -- keeps v1.2 scope focused on design refresh
- [v1.2]: Dark-only for v1.2 -- light mode toggle deferred to v1.3
- [v1.2]: Hybrid table+detail layout for experiments -- preserves comparison capability
- [Phase 12]: Pathless layout routes for two-branch route tree (LandingLayout vs AppLayout)
- [Phase 12]: Placeholder landing page with CTA (not redirect) to validate route structure
- [Phase 12]: Sidebar branding shortened to "Nostradamus" for sidebar width constraints
- [Phase 13]: Single-file landing page component with inline blocks array -- no sub-components for static content
- [Phase 13]: Plain divs with bg-secondary/50 for How It Works cards instead of shadcn Card component
- [Phase 13]: Banner image via Vite static import with hard build failure if missing

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Exact silverreyes.net oklch palette values need verification against live site at start of Phase 11
- Experiments hybrid layout approach committed in requirements; no further design ambiguity
