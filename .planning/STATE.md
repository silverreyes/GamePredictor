# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-22)

**Core value:** Pre-game win/loss predictions with calibrated confidence scores that beat trivial baselines on the 2023 validation season
**Current focus:** v1.1 Point Spread Model -- Phase 7: Spread Model Training

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 10 (Spread Model Training) -- first phase of v1.1
Plan: None yet (ready to plan)
Status: Ready to plan Phase 7
Last activity: 2026-03-22 -- Roadmap created for v1.1

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (0/4 v1.1 phases)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (from v1.0):**
- Total plans completed: 17
- Average duration: 5.6min
- Total execution time: 1.58 hours

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**From v1.0:**
- 06-01: Preserved log_experiment() with JSONL-only logging, removed MLflow side-effect entirely
- 06-01: Removed setup_mlflow() function entirely rather than leaving as no-op
- 06-02: Added .gitattributes for LF enforcement on shell scripts (prevents CRLF Docker breakage on Windows)

**v1.1 prototyping:**
- Spread training script (train_spread.py) mirrors classifier structure, loads target from parquet cache (no DB needed for training)
- Spread Exp 1 baseline: MAE 10.68, RMSE 13.87, derived win accuracy 60.16% (vs classifier 62.89%)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
