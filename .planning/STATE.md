# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-15)

**Core value:** Pre-game win/loss predictions with calibrated confidence scores that beat trivial baselines on the 2023 validation season
**Current focus:** Phase 3: Model Training and Autoresearch (COMPLETE, awaiting checkpoint verification)

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 6 (Model Training and Autoresearch) -- ALL PLANS COMPLETE
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (COMPLETE, checkpoint pending)
Status: 03-03-PLAN complete, awaiting human verification of experiment results
Last activity: 2026-03-17 — Completed 03-03-PLAN.md (autoresearch loop, 62.89% accuracy)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 8
- Average duration: 4.9min
- Total execution time: 0.65 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-data-foundation | 2 | 8min | 4min |
| 02-feature-engineering | 3 | 10min | 3.3min |
| 03-model-training-and-autoresearch | 3 | 21min | 7min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-02 (3min), 02-03 (1min), 03-01 (7min), 03-02 (5min), 03-03 (9min)
- Trend: stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases in strict linear dependency order -- no parallelization possible
- [Roadmap]: Autoresearch loop is the centerpiece of Phase 3 and requires governance setup before experiments begin
- [Phase 01]: Used nflreadpy (not archived nfl-data-py) as data source library
- [Phase 01]: Schema drift detection raises KeyError with descriptive message for missing columns
- [Phase 01]: Separated nflreadpy download into private retry-decorated functions for testability
- [Phase 01]: Chunked upsert at 5000 rows to avoid memory issues with large PBP seasons
- [Phase 02]: Per-season rolling reset via groupby(['team', 'season']) -- NFL rosters change between seasons
- [Phase 02]: Expanding window (not fixed-size) as primary rolling approach
- [Phase 02]: Ties counted as 0.5 in win rate computation
- [Phase 02]: EPA computed from pass/run plays only (EPA_PLAY_TYPES filter)
- [Phase 02]: Turnover differential via self-merge on opponent turnovers committed
- [Phase 02]: 6 leakage tests (not 5) -- added monotonic information test for expanding window correctness
- [Phase 02]: CLI defaults to dry run (--no-store) for safety
- [Phase 02]: DDL column order follows pipeline rolling_cols list order for consistency
- [Phase 03]: Upgraded pandas 1.5.3 to 2.3.3 for numpy 2.x compatibility (required by ML deps)
- [Phase 03]: Prior-season lookup uses home perspective first, fills from away perspective only if not already set
- [Phase 03]: In-sample 2021/2022 evaluation documented as NOT held-out; training includes all 2005-2022
- [Phase 03]: log_experiment accepts optional jsonl_path parameter for testability
- [Phase 03]: Full 17-feature set is near-optimal -- all ablation experiments hurt accuracy
- [Phase 03]: Lower learning rate (0.1) + early stopping is the biggest improvement lever for generalization
- [Phase 03]: Experiment 1 always kept unconditionally as initial baseline (no prior best to compare)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: nfl-data-py column schema across seasons (2005-2024) needs live verification before feature engineering
- [Research]: Exact package versions should be verified on PyPI before pinning in pyproject.toml
- [Research]: Autoresearch loop agent interface (how agent is invoked, reads results, triggers revert) needs specification before Phase 3
