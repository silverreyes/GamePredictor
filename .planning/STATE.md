## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- 06-01: Preserved log_experiment() with JSONL-only logging, removed MLflow side-effect entirely
- 06-01: Removed setup_mlflow() function entirely rather than leaving as no-op
- 06-02: Added .gitattributes for LF enforcement on shell scripts (prevents CRLF Docker breakage on Windows)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None -- all v1.0 research concerns resolved during execution.
