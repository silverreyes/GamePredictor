### v1.2 Design & Landing Page (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Align the Nostradamus dashboard with the silverreyes.net design system, add a proper landing page as the new front door, and redesign the experiments view for readability.

- [x] **Phase 11: Design System Foundation** - Migrate dashboard to silverreyes.net warm amber palette, typography, and semantic tokens (completed 2026-03-24)
- [x] **Phase 12: Route Restructure and Navigation** - Move This Week to `/this-week`, add Home nav item, landing page route at `/` (completed 2026-03-24)
- [ ] **Phase 13: Landing Page** - Hero section, how-it-works explainer, explore CTAs, and footer at `/`
- [ ] **Phase 14: Experiments Redesign** - Full descriptions, proper column alignment, hybrid summary+detail layout

## Phase Details

### Phase 11: Design System Foundation
**Goal**: Every dashboard component renders with the silverreyes.net visual identity -- warm amber palette, Syne + IBM Plex Mono typography, and semantic color tokens replacing all hardcoded Tailwind classes
**Depends on**: Phase 10 (v1.1 complete)
**Requirements**: DSGN-01, DSGN-02, DSGN-03, DSGN-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Dashboard background, text, and accent colors visually match the silverreyes.net warm amber palette (near-black background, amber accents, warm text tones)
  2. All headings render in Syne and all body/code text renders in IBM Plex Mono, with no flash of unstyled text on page load
  3. No hardcoded Tailwind color classes (zinc-*, blue-*, gray-*) remain in any component -- all colors reference semantic CSS custom properties
  4. All shadcn/ui components (buttons, cards, tooltips, dropdowns) display correctly with the remapped theme tokens -- no broken styles, missing borders, or invisible text
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 11-01-PLAN.md — Theme foundation: silverreyes.net palette, @fontsource fonts, tier/status tokens
- [x] 11-02-PLAN.md — Component migration: replace all hardcoded Tailwind color classes with semantic tokens

### Phase 12: Route Restructure and Navigation
**Goal**: The application routes are reorganized so `/` serves the landing page in a standalone layout while all dashboard pages live under their own routes with the sidebar, and navigation reflects the new structure
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: NAV-01, NAV-02, NAV-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Navigating to `/` renders a full-width page with no sidebar or dashboard chrome
  2. Navigating to `/this-week` renders the existing This Week page inside the dashboard layout with sidebar
  3. Sidebar displays a Home tab that links to `/`, and all other nav items point to their correct routes with proper active-state highlighting
  4. All previously bookmarkable dashboard routes (`/accuracy`, `/experiments`, `/history`) continue to work without changes
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 12-01-PLAN.md — Route restructure: two layout branches (LandingLayout + AppLayout), Home nav item, sidebar branding update

### Phase 13: Landing Page
**Goal**: Visitors arriving at `/` see a polished, informative landing page that communicates what Nostradamus does, how it works, and invites them to explore the dashboard
**Depends on**: Phase 11, Phase 12
**Requirements**: LAND-01, LAND-02, LAND-03, LAND-04, LAND-05, LAND-06, LAND-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Landing page displays a hero section with "NFL Nostradamus" headline in Syne display font, a tagline subtitle, and the validation accuracy stat (62.9%) with amber accent styling
  2. Landing page displays a "How It Works" section with four scannable blocks covering Data, Features, Models, and Pipeline
  3. Landing page displays explore CTAs -- a primary amber "Explore Prediction History" button and secondary links to Accuracy and Experiments -- that navigate to the correct dashboard routes
  4. Landing page displays a footer with "Built by Silver Reyes" linking to silverreyes.net and a GitHub link
  5. Landing page is responsive -- hero headline and accuracy stat are visible without scrolling on mobile viewports
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 13-01: TBD
- [ ] 13-02: TBD

### Phase 14: Experiments Redesign
**Goal**: The experiments page presents each experiment with full context and proper visual hierarchy, making it easy to scan, compare, and understand what was tested and why
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: EXPR-01, EXPR-02, EXPR-03, EXPR-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Experiment table columns are properly aligned -- headers sit directly above their corresponding data columns with no visual drift
  2. Each experiment displays its full title and a layman-friendly explanation of what was tested, without truncation, while preserving technical detail (parameters, features, SHAP) in an expandable detail panel
  3. Experiments use a hybrid layout: sortable summary rows for quick comparison with an expandable detail panel per experiment for deep-dive information
  4. The kept (production) experiment is visually distinguishable from reverted experiments through accent border or background treatment, not just a text badge
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 14-01: TBD
- [ ] 14-02: TBD

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14
Note: Phases 13 and 14 are independent and could execute in either order once 11 and 12 are complete.
